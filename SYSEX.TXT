FM Midi Synth driver Version 2.0

System Exclusive Information

The FM Synth driver is a bi-directional driver: it provides
a MIDI input port in order to implement System Exclusive
dumps.  The driver can send or receive System Exclusive data
and recieve commands.  The general format of a SysEx message
is as follows:

     F0      	MIDI Sys Ex
     00,00, 5B  Manufacturers' ID: WinJammer Software Ltd.
     7F      	Device ID -- Must be present
     01      	Model ID -- FM Synth Driver
     xx      	Command ID -- See Below
     aa      	Address MSB -- Location: Bank#,
                Percussion or System
     aa      	Address LSB -- Timbre# or Parameter
     ss      	Size MSB of following Data Block or
             	#Bytes to dump
     ss      	Size LSB
     data    	Data if send request, otherwise blank
     F7      	End of Exclusive Command

Command ID

     Code     Meaning
     (Hex)
     11       Request Data from Driver
     12       Send Data to the Driver, Send Data
              to the Application
     15       Reset Driver to Power-on state
     16       Reset Timbre Banks
     
In order to receive system exclusive dumps from the driver,
the FM Synth SysEx Input driver must be attached to an
application input port.  It is then a simple matter of
sending the desired starting address, and a size describing
the amount of data to dump.  The data received from the
driver contains a command id of 12 hex, so that the data is in
the proper format to be shipped back to the driver at any
time.

The Reset Timbre Bank message and the Reset Driver message
contain only a single Command ID code -- no address or size
bytes.

Address Bytes

The address bytes, together determine where data will be
stored.  See below for specific locations.

Size Bytes

The total size of the data block is determined by combining
the size bytes (7 bits of each).  Data is stored or dumped
consecutively in Address order -- this means that you can
fill or dump the entire contents of the driver with one data
block.

Timbre Banks

Individual timbres or entire banks may be uploaded to the
driver.  The new timbre parameters remain until the driver is
reset.  You can send the sysex block as if the Banks and
timbres were stored consecutively.  Individual parameters
can be written to by placing a value in the address offset
(LSB).  The new timbre will not take effect until a program
change is made to access the timbre.

Each timbre is 24 bytes long.  Each bank holds 128 timbres.
There are 3,072 bytes in an entire Bank message (plus
header).  All five banks can be filled by one 15,360 byte
message (plus header).

Percussion Timbres

Version 2.0 of the FM Synth driver adds percussion bank 
loading.  The driver System Exclusive codes are backwardly
compatible with previous versions.  In addition a new 
address is available to Transmit and Receive the entire
128 note percussion bank.  The ALL dump continues to
dump the percussion bank as listed below, but you can
retrieve and set the full percussion bank by using address
12 Hex.

General MIDI defines 47 drum notes, and the driver has
storage for 47 drum timbres (128 for version 2.0).  
The percussion timbres use the percussion voice# parameter 
to decide which of the 5 drum voices to sound for the drum 
tone.  In addition a percussion mapping of Key to Timbre is 
implemented, and may be dumped and loaded.  There are 47 slots 
in the percussion map, which cover MIDI notes 35 to 81 (in other 
words, array element 0 corresponds to MIDI note 35).  Each slot 
is 2 bytes, so the map is 94 byes long:

              Percussion Map Slot
     Offset   Meaning
     01       Timbre number to sound (0-46)
     02       MIDI Note to play for the key
              (60 = Middle C)

The above map is not required for the Version 2.0 percussion bank,
as all the parameters are contained within the timbre specification.  
For compatibility, it will still be dumped and received, however.

System Parameters Exclusive Format

Certain driver configuration parameters may be sent to or
received from the driver.  Following is the format for the
system parameter dump and load.  The address to use for
system parameters is 22 hex for version 2.00 (version 1.x 
used 20 hex):

Offset  Description            Allowed Values

00    Stereo Mode              0 = Mono, 1 = Stereo
01    Percussion Mode          0 = Off, 1 = On
02    Percussion Channel       if Percussion mode = 1:
                               channel = 0-15 (i.e. MIDI
                               channel 10 is value 9)
03    Default Bank             0-4 (Bank1 - Bank5)
04    Vibrato Depth            0 = light, 1 = deep
05    Tremolo Depth            0 = light, 1 = deep
06    Bend Range               0-12 semitones (1 octave)
07    Save these settings      1 = Save the settings in
                               the INI file
08    Channel 0 -- MIDI        0 = Off, 1 = On
      Channel Map

:     :                        which channels to receive
                               on and play.
23    Channel 15               0 = Off, 1 = On

For Version 2.0 a new address is supplied: 22 Hex.  This address
will transmit and receive all of the above parameters plus the
new Percussion Boost:

24    Percussion Boost         64 is the mid point (no Boost)
                               65 - 127 is positive boost, 63 - 0
                               is negative boost (attenuation).

Examples

The following message will send a timbre to the first bank,
timbre slot 12 (Vibraphone).  All numbers are in
hexadecimal:

     F0, 00, 00, 5B, 7F, 01, 12 Header & Send Request
     00, 0B, 00, 28        	Bank#1,Timbre#12, Size: 40

     F7            	        End of Exclusive
     
This message requests the driver to send timbre#13, 14, and
15 from the 2nd Bank:

     F0, 00, 00, 5B,    	Header & Dump
     7F, 01, 11,          	Request
     01, 0C, 00, 3C, F7   	Bank#2, Timbre#14, Size: 60

The next message requests the driver to reset all the patch
banks to the startup state:

     F0, 00, 00, 5B,      Header & Reset
